Implement an application to speed up the process of coin flip for an EDH pod of 4 players. 

Requirements 
- The application must accept an integer number greater than 0 and flip a coin that number of times for each player, and present the results for each player e.g. heads=3 tails=4 
- There is a single button to roll that number of times for each player 
- The application must be implemented in native JavaScript (no frameworks) and run in a Browser 
- The application UI must be responsive so when using a browser on a mobile device it adapts to the smaller screen 
- The application UI must be neat and look like it is related with the MTG Goblin themed
- The application must be named The Goblin Coin Flipper
- Create some suspense by delaying the result for 2 seconds and create an animation like a coin flipping while waiting. During this animation you can't click on the button so you have to wait for the result before asking for another flip
- Use the best practices of software design

Take your time to make sure you do something great!
